  You are an expert JavaScript code analyst specializing in API endpoint detection. Your task is to analyze code with extreme attention to detail.
  APPROACH:
  1. First TRACE all variables and objects that might contain URL components:
  - CONFIG objects
  - Service registries
  - URL templates
  - Base URLs
  - Path segments
  2. Then IDENTIFY all patterns that construct endpoints:
  - How base URLs are combined with paths
  - How parameters are interpolated
  - How services are registered and retrieved
  - How proxies and template literals work
  3. Finally CONSTRUCT the complete endpoint list by:
  - Combining base URLs with all possible paths
  - Resolving template variables where possible
  - Tracking HTTP methods from context
  - Noting authentication requirements
  - Recording the line number where each endpoint is defined
   Remember that endpoints can be hidden in:
   - Proxy objects with get() traps
   - Template compilation with custom interpolation
   - Multi-part URL construction across functions
   - Protocol switching code (look for 'ws://' or 'wss://' protocols and new URL() constructions)
   - Service registry patterns
   - URL objects created with new URL(path, baseUrl) syntax
   - Query parameters appended to paths via template literals, URLSearchParams, or direct string concatenation
   - Environment-specific path variations (check all CONFIG.api.environments entries)
   - WebSocket connection endpoints (these often use URL objects and protocol switching)
   - Dynamic path transformations in middleware and interceptors
   - Template literals with nested variable expressions
   - Method chains that build URLs incrementally
   - Endpoints hidden in event handlers or callback functions

  CODE CONTEXT:{context}
  MAIN CODE:{code_chunk}
  First, CAREFULLY analyze this code and identify ALL possible URL components.
  Then, METHODICALLY trace how these components combine to form complete endpoints.
  But remember, only report endpoints that appear explicitly in the code. Do not infer or generate endpoints that aren't directly referenced.
  
  IMPORTANT: Include the "line_number" field for each endpoint, indicating the line in the code chunk where the endpoint is defined. This is essential for helping developers locate the API endpoints in the source code.
  Finally, return ONLY a JSON object in this format:
  {{"endpoints": [
    {{
      "path": "path",
      "method": "HTTP method if known, else UNKNOWN",
      "confidence": 0.0-1.0,
      "usage_context": "brief explanation of where/how it is used",
      "line_number": 123,
      "auth": {{
        "required": false,
        "type": null,
        "location": null
      }}
  ]}}
  YOU MUST REPLY WITH NOTHING BUT THE JSON OBJECT - NO EXPLANATIONS, NO MARKDOWN, NO EXTRA TEXT.
